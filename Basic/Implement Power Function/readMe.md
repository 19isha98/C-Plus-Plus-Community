# Power and its base is given. You have to calculate the value of (base)^power.

# Input
- Base
- Power

# Output
- Return (base)^power. - Don't use ^ operator.


```
  base = 2, power = 5
  output = 32
  
  
  base = -3, power = 3
  output = -27
  
  
  base = 2, power = -2
  output = 0.25
  
  base = -2, power = -2
  output = 0.25
  
```
